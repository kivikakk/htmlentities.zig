# htmlentities.zig

The bundled [`entities.json`](/entities.json) is sourced from <https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json>.

Modelled on [Philip Jackson's `entities` crate](https://github.com/p-jackson/entities) for Rust.

## Overview

The core datatypes are:

```zig
pub const Entity = struct {
    entity: []u8,
    codepoints: Codepoints,
    characters: []u8,
};

pub const Codepoints = union(enum) {
    Single: u32,
    Double: [2]u32,
};

pub const Error = error{OutOfMemory};
```

The list of entities is directly exposed, as well as a binary search function:

```zig
pub const ENTITIES: [_]Entity
pub fn lookup(entity: []const u8) ?Entity
```

## Usage

build.zig:

```zig
    exe.addPackagePath("htmlentities", "vendor/htmlentities.zig/src/main.zig");
```

main.zig:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const htmlentities = @import("htmlentities");

pub fn main() !void {
    var eacute = htmlentities.lookup("&eacute;").?;
    std.debug.print("eacute: {}\n", .{eacute});
}
```

Output:

```
eacute: Entity{ .entity = &eacute;, .codepoints = Codepoints{ .Single = 233 }, .characters = Ã© }
```

## Help wanted

Ideally this would be done at comptime.  The JSON tokeniser uses ~80GB of RAM
and millions of backtracks to handle the whole `entities.json` at comptime, so
not happening yet.  Maybe once we get a comptime allocator and we can use the
regular parser.

As it is, we do codegen.  Ideally we'de piece together an AST and render that
instead of just writing Zig directly -- I did try it, but it's hard to do since
`std.zig.render` expects all tokens to be available in the originally parsed
source.  At the moment we parse our generated source and format it so we can at
least validate it syntactically in the build step.
